🎓 NUS SPH6004 — Machine Learning Assignments 🚀
Welcome to my repository for NUS SPH6004! This repo contains my implementations for Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, covering fundamental and advanced machine learning techniques. 🧠✨

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to reach out! Happy coding! 🎉

📌 What's Inside?
📝 Assignment 1: Understanding ML from Scratch
🔹 models/
Implemented classic ML algorithms from scratch using only numpy & pandas:
✔️ Linear Regression
✔️ Logistic Regression
✔️ Random Forest
✔️ Decision Tree
✔️ SVM (with SMO)
✔️ AdaBoost
✔️ Gradient Boosting (GBDT)

🔹 baseline/
This contains the step-by-step implementation along with some extra experiments.
For quick debugging, I used a small-scale dataset, but feel free to test on full data! 🚀

💡 Why This Repo?
This repository is designed to help you truly understand ML algorithms by implementing them from the ground up. If you're tired of just using sklearn, this is your chance to dive deep and see how things really work! 🔍🔥
